  "summary": "Installed Laravel Dusk (via local composer.phar), created .env.dusk.local using MySQL creds with separate multi_food_db_dusk, installed matching ChromeDriver 142; adjusted Beauty browser tests to extend Tests\\DuskTestCase and create admin without factory. Browser tests still failing: AdminSalonApprovalTest missing expected 'Pending Verification' UI and CustomerBookingWizardTest missing @book-now-button selector. Manual dev server used for Dusk; stopped afterward. kluster tools unavailable, so dependency/code review checks not run.",
  "current_status": "Dusk setup in place; Beauty browser tests failing due to UI/selector gaps, further UI/flow implementation needed to pass."
