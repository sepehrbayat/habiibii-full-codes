{"summary": "Fixed critical security vulnerability in PaymobController callback method. Added proper validation to ensure HMAC secret is not null or empty before calling hash_hmac(). When secret is invalid, the method now properly logs the error and returns a failure response instead of silently continuing, preventing potential authentication bypass.", "current_status": "Security fix completed. PaymobController now properly validates HMAC secret and fails securely when configuration is malformed."}
