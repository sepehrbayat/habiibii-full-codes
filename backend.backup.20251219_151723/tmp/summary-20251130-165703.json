  "summary": "Fixed 'Attempt to read property store_id on null' error in BeautySalonController by replacing $request->vendor with Helpers::get_vendor_data() and Helpers::get_store_data() pattern. Created a reusable getVendorAndStore() helper method to reduce code duplication. Updated all 10 methods in BeautySalonController. Then created a comprehensive prompt file (tmp/user-dashboard-beauty-sync-prompt.md) for Cursor AI to generate a plan for integrating Beauty Booking module features into the main user dashboard, covering widgets, statistics, navigation, integration points, and implementation phases.",
  "current_status": "BeautySalonController is now fixed and working. A detailed prompt has been created for planning the user dashboard integration with beauty module features. The prompt covers all admin, vendor, and customer features, identifies integration points, file structure, technical considerations, and provides a clear roadmap for implementation."
