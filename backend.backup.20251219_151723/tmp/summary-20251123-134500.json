  "summary": "Fixed asset loading issue by creating symlink from public/public to public/assets. Updated APP_URL from localhost to http://127.0.0.1:8000. Cleared configuration and view caches. The application should now load CSS and JS files correctly. The issue was that views use asset('public/assets/...') which creates /public/assets/... path, so created symlink to make public/public/assets point to public/assets.",
  "current_status": "Application setup complete. Asset loading issue fixed with symlink. APP_URL updated. Server running on http://127.0.0.1:8000. Ready for development."
