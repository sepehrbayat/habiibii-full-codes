  "summary": "Tested admin dashboard in automated browser. Found critical Blade compilation issue: compiled view files contain literal Blade syntax ({{asset('...')}}) instead of compiled PHP code (<?php echo e(asset('...')); ?>). This causes browser to see Blade syntax in URLs like %7B%7Basset('public/assets/admin/css/fonts.css')%7D%7D. Also fixed jQuery $ is not a function errors in common.js by wrapping jQuery-dependent code in availability checks. Cleared all Laravel caches but issue persists - Blade is not compiling asset() directives properly.",
  "current_status": "Critical issue: Blade is not compiling {{asset()}} directives in admin layout. Compiled view files contain literal Blade syntax. This causes all CSS/JS assets to fail loading with 404 errors. Need to investigate why Blade compiler is not processing these directives. jQuery errors fixed in common.js. Dashboard loads but styles are broken due to missing CSS files."
