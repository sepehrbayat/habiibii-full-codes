  "summary": "Fixed asset paths by removing 'public/' prefix from all asset() calls in admin layout. The issue was that asset() helper already points to public directory, so adding 'public/' created double paths like /public/public/assets/. Fixed all CSS and JS asset paths. However, Blade compilation issue persists - compiled views still contain literal Blade syntax instead of compiled PHP. JS files are loading correctly now, but CSS files still show Blade syntax in URLs. Need to investigate why Blade compiler is not processing CSS link tags.",
  "current_status": "Asset paths fixed - removed public/ prefix. JS files loading correctly (200 OK). CSS files still showing Blade syntax in URLs (%7B%7Basset...%7D%7D). Dashboard partially working - JS loaded but styles broken. Blade compilation issue needs further investigation."
