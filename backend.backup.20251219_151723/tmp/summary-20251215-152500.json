  "summary": "Successfully fixed API routing - /api/* requests now correctly route to Laravel and return JSON responses (200 OK). Root URL still redirects to /index.html. Fixed Apache configuration using RewriteRule with [PT,L] flags to exclude /api from proxying to React, allowing Laravel's .htaccess to handle API routes. API endpoints tested: /api/v1/config returns JSON, /api/v1/auth/login returns validation errors (confirming Laravel is working). Next: Fix root URL redirect issue.",
