  "summary": "Fixed jQuery '$ is not a function' error in common.js. The issue was that line 126 was trying to use jQuery ($) immediately when the script loaded, before jQuery was available. Wrapped the code in a $(document).ready() handler so it waits for both DOM and jQuery to be ready before executing. This fixes the Uncaught TypeError errors. Cleared all caches.",
  "current_status": "jQuery error fixed. The $ usage at line 126 is now wrapped in document ready handler. User should refresh browser to see the fix. Other warnings (Firebase, missing images) are non-critical and don't affect functionality."
