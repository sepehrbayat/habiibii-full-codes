  "summary": "Implemented all Phase 2 refinements for Beauty Booking module. Completed P0 merge-blocking items: added unique DB constraints to prevent duplicate transactions, created composite index for booking overlap queries, and added comprehensive unit tests for idempotency and status transitions. Completed P1 high-priority items: implemented subscription auto-renewal command with wallet payment support, added auto_renew column migration, and enhanced ranking algorithm with Bayesian weighted rating for salons with few reviews. Completed P2 medium-priority items: added feature flag gating to admin sidebar for staged rollout, implemented admin refund completion action for digital payments, and added cache invalidation to revenue service for subscription changes. All changes follow Laravel and module coding standards with bilingual comments.",
  "current_status": "All Phase 2 refinement tasks completed. The module now has improved data integrity (unique constraints), better query performance (composite indexes), comprehensive test coverage, subscription auto-renewal capability, enhanced ranking algorithm, feature flag support, and complete refund workflow. Ready for testing and deployment."
