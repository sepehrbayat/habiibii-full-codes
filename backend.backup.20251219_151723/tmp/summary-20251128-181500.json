  "summary": "Fixed critical transaction atomicity bug in BeautyBookingService: moved booking status and payment status updates inside transactions when revenue recording is required. Previously, status updates happened outside the transaction, creating data inconsistency where booking could show as paid/confirmed without revenue being recorded. Now both operations are atomic - if revenue recording fails, status update is also rolled back. Fixed in both updatePaymentStatus() and updateBookingStatus() methods. Created TRANSACTION_ATOMICITY_FIX.md documentation.",
  "current_status": "Critical transaction atomicity bug fixed. Payment status update: ✅ Moved inside transaction when revenue recording needed. Booking status update: ✅ Moved inside transaction when revenue recording needed. Data consistency: ✅ Ensured - booking cannot show as paid/confirmed without revenue recorded. Atomicity: ✅ Maintained - both operations succeed or both fail. All fixes verified, no linter errors. Module has improved data integrity and financial accuracy."
