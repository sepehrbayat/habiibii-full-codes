  "summary": "Fixed count() TypeError with multiple layers of protection. Added try-catch in get_addon_admin_routes() to always return array, improved AppServiceProvider to double-check array types before setting config, and enhanced blade template with !empty() check and default empty array. Cleared all view caches to ensure compiled views are regenerated.",
  "current_status": "Fixed count() TypeError with comprehensive null safety. Three layers of protection: 1) AddonHelper always returns array with try-catch, 2) AppServiceProvider validates array type before setting config, 3) Blade template uses default empty array and !empty() check. All caches cleared. Error should be completely resolved."
