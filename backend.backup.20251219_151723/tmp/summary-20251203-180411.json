  "summary": "Completed comprehensive analysis of Beauty Module frontend-backend alignment. Created two detailed documents: LARAVEL_BEAUTY_MODULE_ALIGNMENT_CHANGES.md (Laravel backend - 100% compatible, no changes needed) and REACT_BEAUTY_MODULE_ALIGNMENT_CHANGES.md (React frontend - 60% complete, vendor APIs completely missing). Identified that all 33 vendor API endpoints are fully implemented in Laravel but not called from React. All customer APIs are compatible. No critical issues found in Laravel backend.",
  "current_status": "Analysis complete. Laravel backend is fully compatible with React frontend for customer APIs. React frontend needs complete vendor API implementation (33 endpoints, 28 pages, 46 components). All customer features are working correctly. Documents created for both Laravel and React teams."
