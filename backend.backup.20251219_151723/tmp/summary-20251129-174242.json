  "summary": "Fixed syntax error in resources/views/layouts/admin/partials/_header.blade.php at line 263. The issue was with the ternary operator syntax in the class attribute - it was missing proper spacing which caused Blade parsing to fail. Changed from {{Config::get('module.current_module_id') == $module->id?'active':''}} to {{ Config::get('module.current_module_id') == $module->id ? 'active' : '' }} with proper spacing. Cleared view cache to apply the fix.",
  "current_status": "Syntax error fixed. View cache cleared. Server is running on port 8000. The admin panel should now load without parse errors. The ternary operator now has proper spacing for better Blade template parsing."
