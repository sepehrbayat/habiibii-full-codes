  "summary": "Fixed ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS issue on /login and other React routes. Root cause: Laravel's .htaccess was processing requests before Apache RewriteRules could proxy them to React. Solution: Switched from RewriteRule to ProxyPass directives, which are processed BEFORE .htaccess. Configuration now uses ProxyPass /api ! to exclude Laravel routes, then ProxyPass / to proxy everything else to React app. All routes now working: root / (200 OK, React), /login (200 OK, React), /cart (200 OK, React), /api/* (200 OK, Laravel JSON).",
  "current_status": "✅ ALL ROUTES WORKING: Root URL, /login, /cart, and all React routes return 200 OK from React app. API endpoints return 200 OK JSON from Laravel. No redirect loops. Server fully functional."
