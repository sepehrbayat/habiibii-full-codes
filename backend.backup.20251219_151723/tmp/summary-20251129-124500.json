  "summary": "Completed full integration of Beauty Booking module across all dashboards and access levels. Updated 12 controller files and helper functions to support beauty module similar to rental module integration. Changes include: Vendor dashboard redirects to beauty dashboard, admin sidebar includes beauty sidebar, subscription packages filter by beauty module type, wallet and withdraw logic handles beauty module, business settings support beauty module, zone controller excludes beauty from zone filtering, search routing filters beauty routes, and helper functions support beauty module for subscription conditions. All changes follow the same pattern as rental module integration.",
  "current_status": "All 12 integration tasks completed. Beauty Booking module is now fully integrated into the system and works across all dashboards (Admin, Vendor, Customer) with all access levels. Module switching, subscription packages, notifications, wallet operations, business settings, and search routing all properly handle beauty module. The module_permission_check() function is generic and already supports beauty module permissions which are seeded in BeautyBookingDatabaseSeeder."
