  "summary": "Fixed null pointer exceptions in SystemController::store_data() method that was causing admin dashboard rendering issues. The method was accessing ->module_id on potentially null results from first() queries. Added proper null checks. Also cleared all Laravel caches (view, config, route, cache) to address Blade compilation issues where CSS/JS assets were showing as literal Blade syntax in browser. Restarted development server.",
  "current_status": "Fixed null pointer exceptions in get-store-data endpoint. Cleared all caches to resolve Blade compilation issues. Server restarted. User should do hard browser refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear browser cache and see the fixes. The dashboard should now render correctly with proper asset URLs instead of literal Blade syntax."
