  "summary": "Fixed parse error in _header.blade.php by converting multi-line @php() directive to proper @php ... @endphp block. The root cause was line 212 which had a @php() single-line directive that spanned multiple lines with nested closures. Single-line @php() syntax cannot handle multi-line code with closures, causing Blade compilation to fail with 'unexpected token endforeach' error. Converted it to a proper multi-line @php ... @endphp block. View now compiles successfully. Cleared view and config cache.",
  "current_status": "Parse error completely fixed. View compiles successfully. The issue was with multi-line @php() directive that needed to be converted to @php ... @endphp block format. Server is running correctly on port 8000."
