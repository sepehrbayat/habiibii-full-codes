  "summary": "Implemented all high-priority improvements from Phase 2 Business Logic Review. Added status transition validation with business rules (pending→confirmed/cancelled, confirmed→completed/cancelled/no_show, terminal states cannot transition). Added service active status check during booking creation (status=1). Added salon verification and active status checks (verification_status=1, is_verified=true, store status and active checks). All validations are properly integrated into the booking creation flow with appropriate error messages. The booking flow is now more robust and prevents invalid operations.",
  "current_status": "Phase 2 high-priority improvements completed. All three critical validation issues have been fixed: status transitions, service active status, and salon verification. The booking system now has proper validation at all critical points. Ready to proceed with Phase 3 (Integration Review) or address medium-priority improvements (badge observers, rating enhancements)."
