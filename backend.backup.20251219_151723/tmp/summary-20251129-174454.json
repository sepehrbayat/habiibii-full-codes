  "summary": "Fixed parse error in _header.blade.php by removing Persian/Farsi comments from @php blocks. The Persian text in PHP comments was causing encoding issues that broke Blade template compilation, resulting in 'unexpected token endforeach' error. Removed all Persian comments from the @php blocks (lines 235-236, 243-244, 248-249) while keeping the English comments and functionality intact. Cleared view and config cache. Server is now responding correctly.",
