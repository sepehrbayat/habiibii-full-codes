  "summary": "Created comprehensive Graphiti workflow system to automatically update knowledge base after each task. Implemented three components: (1) graphiti-sync-workflow.php - PHP class with GraphitiKnowledgeBaseUpdater that handles knowledge base updates, task history tracking, and Graphiti server synchronization; (2) graphiti-task-wrapper.sh - Bash wrapper script that automatically wraps any command to update knowledge base and sync with Graphiti after task completion; (3) GRAPHITI_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md - Complete documentation with usage examples, integration instructions, and troubleshooting. The workflow tracks task name, timestamp, changes made, and affected files in task_history array. Updated knowledge base JSON to include task_history section with initial entries documenting all previous tasks. System automatically keeps last 50 tasks and attempts to sync with Graphiti server at http://localhost:8001/mcp/ after each task. All files validated and ready for use.",
  "current_status": "Graphiti workflow system is complete and operational. Knowledge base now includes task_history tracking with 3 initial entries. Workflow components created: PHP sync class, Bash wrapper script, and comprehensive documentation. System ready for integration into daily development workflow. Knowledge base JSON updated to version 1.0.1 with last_modified timestamps. All files validated and tested. Next step: Use the wrapper script for all future tasks to automatically maintain Graphiti knowledge base."
