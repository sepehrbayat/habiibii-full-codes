  "summary": "Fixed 5 critical bugs in BeautyBooking module: (1) Corrected ranking algorithm fallback weights to match config defaults (location 25%, featured 20%, rating 18% instead of 30%, 25%, 20%); (2) Fixed badge service fallback rating from 4.5 to 4.8 to match config; (3) Fixed duplicate subscription creation bug - moved subscription creation inside cash_payment and wallet cases with early returns to prevent duplicate creation; (4) Fixed hardcoded 'png' extension in document upload - now detects actual file extension (pdf, jpeg, jpg, png); (5) Fixed inconsistent rating comparison operators - changed scopeTopRated from '>' to '>=' to match BeautyBadgeService logic. All bugs verified and fixed. No linter errors.",
  "current_status": "All 5 critical bugs have been fixed. Ranking algorithm now uses correct fallback weights matching config. Badge system uses consistent 4.8 rating threshold. Subscription purchase no longer creates duplicates. Document uploads preserve correct file extensions. Rating comparisons are now consistent across the application. Module is ready for testing."
