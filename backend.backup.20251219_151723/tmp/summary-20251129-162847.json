  "summary": "Fixed script placement issue in customer dashboard views. The beauty-confirmation.js script tags were placed after @endsection, causing them to not be rendered in the HTML output. Moved the script tags inside the @section('content') block just before @endsection in both booking-detail.blade.php and bookings.blade.php, ensuring the scripts are properly included in the rendered HTML and confirmation dialogs will work correctly.",

Confirmation dialogs for data-confirm attributes will now work correctly in customer dashboard views. All files pass linting."
