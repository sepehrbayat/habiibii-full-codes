  "summary": "Fixed class_exists() autoloading issue in User and Store model relationships. Changed autoload parameter from false to true in class_exists() checks for BeautyBooking relationships. This ensures Laravel's autoloader can load the classes when the module is published but the classes haven't been loaded yet. Previously, using autoload=false would cause the relationship to return empty results even when the module was published and the class would be auto-loadable.",
