  "summary": "Rebuilt the Laravel application for testing after fixing two bugs: 1) theme.min.js loading race condition fixed by using proper script loading with async=false and defer=false, appended to head with jQuery availability checks. 2) Sidebar help link active state fixed by changing path check from 'backoffice/beautybooking/help*' to 'admin/beautybooking/help*' to match actual route paths. All caches cleared, autoloader regenerated, and optimization caches rebuilt.",
  "current_status": "Application rebuilt successfully. All caches cleared and regenerated. Theme.min.js loading fix and sidebar active state fix are ready for testing. The app should now load theme.min.js properly after jQuery is available, and the help sidebar link will correctly show active state when viewing help pages."
