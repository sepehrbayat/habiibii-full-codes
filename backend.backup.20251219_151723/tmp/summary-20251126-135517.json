  "summary": "Fixed indentation bug in BeautyBookingService.php line 1023. The line `$cancellationFee = $this->calculateCancellationFee($booking);` was incorrectly placed at the same indentation level as the if statement, causing it to execute unconditionally. Fixed by adding proper indentation (4 spaces) to place it inside the `if ($cancelledBy === 'customer')` conditional block.",
  "current_status": "Indentation bug fixed. The cancellation fee calculation now correctly executes only when the booking is cancelled by the customer, not unconditionally. All linting checks passed."
