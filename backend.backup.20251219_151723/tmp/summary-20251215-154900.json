  "summary": "Successfully implemented expert solution for root URL redirect issue. Added explicit RewriteRule ^/?$ to proxy root / to React app before Apache checks for directories. Root URL now returns 200 OK with React HTML content (X-Powered-By: Next.js). All API endpoints still working correctly (200 OK, JSON responses from Laravel). Final Apache configuration uses ordered RewriteRules: 1) Exclude /api for Laravel, 2) Explicitly proxy root / to React, 3) Serve static files locally, 4) Proxy all other requests to React. Problem completely resolved.",
  "current_status": "✅ DEPLOYMENT FULLY FUNCTIONAL: Root URL serves React app (200 OK), API endpoints route to Laravel (200 OK, JSON), all routing rules working correctly. Server is production-ready."
