{"summary": "Fixed PaymobController null payment_data bug: Added null checks before calling payment_response() method at three locations (lines 315, 343, and 351). The payment_response method accesses payment_info->id which would cause errors if payment_data is null. Added fallback redirect to payment-fail route when payment_data is not found, with proper error logging.", "current_status": "PaymobController null safety fix applied. All three payment_response calls now check for null payment_data before proceeding, preventing potential errors when payment requests are not found in the database."}
