  "summary": "Added payment processing and revenue recording for retail orders. Implemented payment hooks (beauty_retail_order_payment_success and beauty_retail_order_payment_fail) in app/helpers.php to handle payment success/failure for retail orders, including revenue recording and notifications. Updated BeautyRetailController to process wallet payments immediately and record revenue when payment is successful. Payment hooks follow the same pattern as beauty booking and subscription payment hooks.",
  "current_status": "Payment processing for retail orders is now complete. Revenue is recorded when retail orders are paid (wallet or online). Payment hooks are in place for gateway payments. Next: Continue reviewing other critical features and ensure all revenue models are properly implemented."
