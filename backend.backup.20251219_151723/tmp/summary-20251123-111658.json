  "summary": "Fixed consultation credit calculation inconsistency. The issue was that consultation credit was calculated using only basePrice, while service fee, tax, and discount were calculated on totalBasePrice (base + additional services). Fixed by: 1) Updated calculateConsultationCredit() call to pass totalBasePrice instead of basePrice, 2) Updated method signature and parameter name to totalBasePrice, 3) Updated credit cap check to use totalBasePrice instead of basePrice. This ensures all calculations (service fee, tax, discount, and consultation credit) are consistent and use the same base amount (totalBasePrice), providing fair credit application across the entire booking amount including additional services.",
  "current_status": "Consultation credit calculation bug fixed. All booking amount calculations (service fee, tax, discount, and consultation credit) now consistently use totalBasePrice (base + additional services). The module's calculation logic is now fully consistent across all components. Ready for Phase 3 (Integration Review) or further enhancements."
