  "summary": "Upgraded Collision to 7.x via local composer.phar, fixed strict_types placement in VendorApiAuthenticationTest.php, and ran Beauty module Feature/Unit tests; all 137 tests errored because migrate:fresh fails (missing order_transactions base table). Repaired graphiti-knowledge-base.json corruption and updated knowledge base; Graphiti sync still failing.",
  "current_status": "Collision updated; code change limited to test file; tests blocked by missing core tables (order_transactions) during migrations. Need DB with base tables or skip DB-heavy tests before rerun."
