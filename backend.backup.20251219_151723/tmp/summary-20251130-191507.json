{\"summary\": \"Fixed three security and logic bugs: (1) Restored POST form with CSRF token for logout in layouts/app.blade.php to prevent logout CSRF attacks. Added POST route for logout while keeping GET route for backward compatibility. (2) Fixed inverted pluck() parameters in get_login_url() helper - changed from pluck(\\\"key\\\",\\\"value\\\") to pluck(\\\"value\\\",\\\"key\\\") to correctly map values by keys for array_search(). (3) Improved logout fallback logic with proper null/false/empty string validation and try-catch blocks for route() calls to handle missing routes gracefully.\", \"current_status\": \"All three bugs fixed. Logout now uses POST with CSRF protection, get_login_url() correctly maps values by keys, and logout fallback handles all error cases properly.\"}
