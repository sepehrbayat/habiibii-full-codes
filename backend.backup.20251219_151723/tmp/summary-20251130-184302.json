{"summary": "Fixed customer logout route error by adding customer_login_url to get_login_url helper function query. The function was only querying for admin and vendor login URLs, missing customer_login_url, which caused the logout redirect to fail with route not found error.", "current_status": "Customer logout route fix applied. get_login_url now includes customer_login_url in its query, allowing proper logout redirect for customers."}
