  "summary": "Fixed redirect loop issue by disabling .htaccess for non-API routes and configuring Apache to properly route /api to Laravel and other requests to React app. Root URL now returns 200 OK from Next.js. API endpoints still need verification - currently returning 404 which suggests routing issue. Need to ensure /api routes are properly excluded from proxying.",
  "current_status": "Deployment partially working - React app accessible, but API routing needs final fix. Apache configuration updated to disable .htaccess for non-API routes to prevent redirect loops."
