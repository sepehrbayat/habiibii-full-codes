  "summary": "Fixed React error #31 (Objects are not valid as a React child) in WalletBoxComponent.js. The issue was caused by rendering balance object directly in JSX. Added getBalanceDisplay() function to safely convert balance to number/string, handling cases where balance is an object, null, undefined, or already a primitive value. Also ensured all balance displays use String() conversion for safe rendering.",
  "current_status": "React error #31 fixed. WalletBoxComponent now safely handles balance values of any type. Next.js rebuilt and restarted. Ready for testing loyalty points page."
