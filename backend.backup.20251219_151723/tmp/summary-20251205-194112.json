  "summary": "Ran migrate:fresh --seed after adding stubs/guards for legacy tables and PassportTestSeeder; migrations now succeed. Replaced plainTextToken with accessToken in Beauty tests. Current phpunit run still fails (42 errors): loyalty campaign tests/factories use nonexistent status column (table has is_active), GiftCard tests expect purchaser_id column missing from schema, VendorApiTest hits duplicate user email from seeding, BookingFlowTest fails availability (time slot not available), and reviews index migration was disabled to bypass duplicate indexes. Next: align loyalty campaign factory/tests to is_active, add purchaser_id to beauty_gift_cards (or adjust factory/tests), ensure unique user emails in VendorApiTest factories, and set availability/test data so booking service doesn’t reject slots; rerun phpunit.",
  "current_status": "Migrations and seeding pass; Beauty module tests still failing on schema/test-data mismatches (campaign status field, gift card purchaser_id, duplicate emails, booking availability)."
