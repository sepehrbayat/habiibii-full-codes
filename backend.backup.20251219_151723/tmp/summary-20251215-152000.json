  "summary": "Fixed redirect loop issue - root URL now returns 200 OK from React app. API routing still needs work - currently being proxied to React instead of Laravel. Tried multiple approaches: RewriteRule with [L], ProxyPass /api !, Location blocks, ProxyPassMatch. None successfully excluded /api from proxying. Root cause: Apache proxy configuration is processing /api requests before Laravel can handle them. Next step: Verify Laravel routes are accessible directly and ensure .htaccess is properly processing /api requests.",
