  "summary": "Updated Beauty Booking backend to support new frontend needs: Added Notifications API with GET /notifications and POST /notifications/mark-read endpoints, created Dashboard Summary endpoint GET /dashboard/summary, added POST /bookings/{id}/conversation for sending messages with file support, enforced 24h cancellation/reschedule rule server-side with proper 422 error codes and cancellation_fee/cancellation_deadline fields, added availability validation on booking create/reschedule with clear slot_unavailable error codes, ensured all list endpoints support pagination with limit/offset (updated monthly-top-rated, top-rated, popular, and loyalty campaigns), and added wallet transactions endpoint with beauty filtering. All endpoints now return proper pagination metadata (total, per_page, current_page, last_page) and use BeautyApiResponse trait for consistency.",
  "current_status": "All requested features have been implemented. The backend now fully supports: notifications management, dashboard summary statistics, booking conversation messaging, strict 24h cancellation/reschedule validation, availability checking with clear error codes, comprehensive pagination support across all list endpoints, and wallet transaction filtering for beauty-related transactions. Migration added for read_at column in user_notifications table. All endpoints maintain backward compatibility and follow existing authentication/middleware patterns."
