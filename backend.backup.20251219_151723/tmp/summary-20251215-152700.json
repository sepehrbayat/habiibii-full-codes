Final Apache configuration uses RewriteRule with [PT,L] flags to exclude /api from proxying, allowing Laravel's .htaccess to handle API routes. All API endpoints tested and working: /api/v1/config returns JSON, /api/v1/auth/login returns validation errors (confirming Laravel is processing requests). Root URL redirect needs further investigation - may be from Laravel's .htaccess or Apache DirectoryIndex behavior.",
