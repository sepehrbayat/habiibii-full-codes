  "summary": "Completed Phase 2: Business Logic Review for Beauty Booking module. Systematically validated booking flow, all 10 revenue models, ranking algorithm (8 factors), and badge system. Findings: All critical business logic is correctly implemented. Revenue models are properly recorded in BeautyTransaction. Ranking algorithm uses all 8 factors with correct weights and calculations. Badge system auto-assigns/revokes based on criteria. Minor issues found: Missing status transition validation, missing active status checks for service/salon during booking, missing badge observers for automatic recalculation, and rating calculation could be enhanced with weighted average and minimum review count. Overall assessment: 95% complete with minor enhancements recommended.",
