{"summary": "Enhanced customer dashboard error handling: 1) Added class_exists() checks before using string class names to prevent ClassNotFoundException, 2) Changed error returns from empty arrays to empty collections to match view expectations (views call ->count() on collections), 3) Added proper logging for debugging. This ensures the dashboard gracefully handles module loading issues and returns the correct data types.", "current_status": "Customer dashboard error handling improved. Service methods now return collections instead of arrays on errors, and class existence is verified before use. Dashboard should handle edge cases better."}
