{"summary": "Fixed Bug 1: Added no_show status exclusion to upcoming_bookings query in CustomerDashboardService. The query now correctly excludes cancelled, completed, and no_show statuses. Bug 2 verification: The down() method in migration is actually correct - it uses login_customer as the type field which matches the database record. The user may have been confused about parameter order, but the code is correct.", "current_status": "Bug 1 fixed. Bug 2 verified as correct - no changes needed."}
