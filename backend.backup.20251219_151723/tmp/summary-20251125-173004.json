  "summary": "Fixed two critical bugs: 1) Form validation in profile.blade.php now properly breaks loop on errors using for loop instead of forEach with return statements. 2) Booking wizard step 4 now properly redirects to step 5 (review) with explicit handling instead of generic nextStep calculation. Both bugs are resolved.",
  "current_status": "Both validation and booking wizard flow bugs are fixed. Forms now validate correctly and wizard navigation is working properly."
