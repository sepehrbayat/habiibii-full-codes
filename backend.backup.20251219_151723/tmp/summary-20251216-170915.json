  "summary": "Fixed React error #31 in BasicInformationForm.js by converting all helperText values to strings. Changed helperText from 'condition && error' pattern to 'condition && error ? String(error) : \"\"' for name, email, password, and confirm_password fields. This prevents React from trying to render error objects as children. Also removed unsupported onError prop from Popover components in previous fixes.",
  "current_status": "React error #31 fixed in BasicInformationForm helperText. All helperText values now safely converted to strings. Next.js rebuilt and restarted. Ready for testing Avatar click in header."
