  "summary": "Fixed additional React Error #31 issue in PushNotificationLayout.js. The main problem was line 140 where error object was being passed directly to toast() function: .catch((err) => toast(err)). Also fixed notification.title and notification.body rendering to use safeString(). Added safeString import and applied fixes to all object rendering in the component. This was the root cause of the persistent React Error #31 after initial fixes.",
  "current_status": "All React Error #31 fixes completed including PushNotificationLayout.js. Application rebuilt and restarted. The error was caused by Firebase messaging error objects being rendered directly in toast notifications. All object rendering issues should now be resolved."
