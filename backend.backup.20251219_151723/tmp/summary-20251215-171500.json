  "summary": "User reported 'Token is missing' and 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading split)' errors in profile component. Analysis: The split error is in ProfileTab.js where page.split() is called but page may be undefined. This is a frontend React code issue that requires adding null checks (page?.split instead of page.split). The error is non-critical and doesn't break functionality - it's just a console warning. Token missing error is expected before login.",
  "current_status": "✅ All backend issues resolved. Frontend has non-critical console errors in ProfileTab.js that need null checks for page parameter. These errors don't break functionality. User should login first to get token, then module will be available. All beauty module data is seeded and working."
