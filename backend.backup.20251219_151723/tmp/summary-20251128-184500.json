  "summary": "Fixed missing return statement bug in updateBookingStatus method. Previously, when status update didn't require revenue recording (else branch), the code updated the status but continued executing side effects code (trackPackageUsage, loyalty points, time slot freeing) for all status updates, not just completed ones. Fixed by: 1) Moving side effects code inside else block with proper return statement, 2) Creating processBookingStatusSideEffects helper method for code reuse, 3) Ensuring side effects only execute when status is 'completed', 4) Both transaction and non-transaction paths now use same helper method for consistency. This prevents unintended side effects for status updates that don't match the revenue recording condition.",
  "current_status": "Missing return statement bug fixed. Side effects containment: ✅ Side effects now properly contained within else block. Code reuse: ✅ Created processBookingStatusSideEffects helper method. Conditional execution: ✅ Side effects only execute when status is completed. Consistency: ✅ Both paths use same helper method. All fixes verified, no linter errors. Module has improved code organization and prevents unintended side effects."
