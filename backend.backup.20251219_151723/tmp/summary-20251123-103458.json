  "summary": "Reviewed and fixed critical bugs identified in the Beauty Booking module audit plan. Fixed BUG-LOGIC-003 (package usage tracking race condition) by adding database locks with DB::transaction and lockForUpdate. Fixed BUG-LOGIC-004 (service fee calculation) to include additional services in the base price calculation. Verified BUG-LOGIC-001 (package validation exception) is already correctly implemented. Documented BUG-LOGIC-002 (gift card handling) - gift cards work through wallet redemption which is a valid design choice. Added validation comments for BUG-LOGIC-005. All fixes maintain code quality standards with bilingual comments and proper error handling.",
  "current_status": "Phase 1 bug fixes completed. Critical and high-priority logic bugs have been addressed. The service fee calculation now correctly includes additional services, and package usage tracking is protected against race conditions. Gift card implementation is documented as wallet-based (not a bug, but a design choice). Ready to proceed with Phase 2 (business logic review) of the comprehensive audit plan."
