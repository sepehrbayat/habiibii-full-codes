  "summary": "Fixed 500 Internal Server Error for booking conversation endpoint by uploading the corrected file to server. The issue was 'Undefined variable $customerInfo' - moved $customerInfo initialization to the top of the try block (line 450) so it's always available before being used at line 546. Cleared all Laravel caches to ensure changes take effect.",
