  "summary": "Fixed 500 Internal Server Error for booking conversation endpoint. The issue was 'Undefined variable $customerInfo' - the variable was only defined inside the 'if (!$conversation)' block but was used later regardless. Moved $customerInfo initialization outside the conditional block so it's always available. Also noted that 403 for wish-list is expected behavior (requires zoneId header).",
  "current_status": "Beauty Booking module testing in progress. Fixed conversation endpoint 500 error. Continue testing booking flow and chat functionality."
