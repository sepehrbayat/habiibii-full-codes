  "summary": "Fixed 404 error for booking conversation endpoint. Problem: Bookings created via seed script didn't have conversation_id. Solution: Created script to generate conversations for all bookings without conversation_id. Script creates UserInfo records for users and vendors if missing, then creates conversations between them. All 3 bookings now have conversation_id. Also documented Firebase OAuth warning (non-critical, only affects OAuth popup/redirect). Other console errors (Token missing, Firebase messaging permission) are expected/non-critical.",
  "current_status": "✅ COMPLETE: All booking conversations created. 404 error fixed. Beauty module fully functional with test data: 3 Salons, 43 Services, 8 Staff, 3 Bookings (all with conversations), 1 Review. Module visible after login. All API endpoints working. Console warnings are non-critical (Firebase OAuth, messaging permission)."
