  "summary": "Fixed two critical bugs in BeautyBooking module: (1) Removed eval() security vulnerability in beauty-confirmation.js by replacing eval() with console warnings for legacy onclick handlers, preventing code injection attacks. (2) Added missing JavaScript includes for beauty-confirmation.js in all views that use data-confirm attributes (admin/booking/view.blade.php, customer/dashboard/booking-detail.blade.php, customer/dashboard/bookings.blade.php), ensuring confirmation dialogs work correctly. The eval() function was executing arbitrary code from onclick attributes without sanitization, creating a code injection vulnerability. Now legacy onclick handlers are logged as warnings instead of being executed.",
  "current_status": "Both bugs fixed. Security vulnerability removed by eliminating eval() usage. All views that use data-confirm attributes now properly include the beauty-confirmation.js script. Confirmation dialogs will now work correctly instead of failing silently. Ready for testing."
