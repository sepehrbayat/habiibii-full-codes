  "summary": "Fixed React error #31 by removing unsupported onError prop from MUI Popover components (AccountPopover and ProfileTabPopover). MUI Popover doesn't support onError prop, which was causing the error. Also improved error handling in isAnchorElValid to silently catch errors without rendering error objects. Added string validation for menu.name in ProfileTabPopover to prevent rendering objects.",
  "current_status": "React error #31 fixed by removing unsupported onError prop from Popover components. Next.js rebuilt and restarted. Ready for testing Avatar click in header."
