  "summary": "Ran VendorApiTest with existing DB; migrate:fresh fails due to missing base tables. Added hasTable/hasColumn guards to legacy migrations (modules, customer_addresses, orders*, order_transactions, parcel_categories) to avoid duplicate/missing column crashes. Tests still fail because banners/orders tables are absent in DB.",
