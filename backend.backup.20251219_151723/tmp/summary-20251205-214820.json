  "summary": "Implemented calendar mocks returning proper types, added duration_minutes to beauty_bookings, block_date/block_type to calendar_blocks, added BeautyReviewFactory, admin role_id migration/seed, ranking distance float casting, unique emails in badge test. Migrate:fresh --seed succeeds. Current phpunit still failing: duplicate user email in VendorApiAuthenticationTest, missing admin_wallets table in booking service test, invalid status transition still raised in unit test, missing BeautyCommissionSettingFactory and badge status enum mismatch in commission tests; many feature tests still failing due to 404/availability after API endpoints not reachable.",
  "current_status": "Beauty module tests still failing (5 errors, many failures). Outstanding: unique email fix in vendor auth test, stub admin_wallets table, adjust booking status transition test expectations, create BeautyCommissionSettingFactory and align badge status enum, resolve API endpoints/availability 404+time slot errors."}
