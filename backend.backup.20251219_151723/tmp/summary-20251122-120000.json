  "summary": "Completed all remaining tasks from the Beauty Booking module review plan. Reviewed and confirmed all migrations have proper indexes and default values. Registered BeautyBookingDatabaseSeeder in DatabaseSeeder.

Confirmed middleware registration (vendor.api and module-check) in Kernel.php. All migrations have comprehensive indexes for frequently queried columns. All enum and boolean columns have default values. No linter errors found. All TODO items from the plan are now completed.",
