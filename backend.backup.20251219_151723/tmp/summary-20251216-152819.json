  "summary": "Analyzed JavaScript errors. 'Token is missing' is a warning when accessing profile without auth (non-critical). 'offsetHeight' error is from minified library (likely tooltip/popover) trying to measure non-existent DOM element - happens during component lifecycle. Firebase errors are expected when user blocks notifications. These errors don't break functionality but could be improved with error boundaries and null checks.",
  "current_status": "Beauty Booking module testing in progress. JavaScript errors identified are mostly non-critical warnings. Main functionality (reschedule, cancel) is working after rate limit and debouncing fixes. Continue testing booking flow."
